      <h1 class="story-focus">WHAT IF!!!</h1>
      <p>
        You lost it all and had to start from absolute [ZERO]. I have been haunted by this single thought for long, what if it happened to me [AGAIN].
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2019, I lost everything I had. I cried, was tired, depressed but that was my breaking point.. I still bounce back.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you lost everything, what would you do to ensure you don't remain at that point?
      </p>
      <p>
        From a N42k salary job to a N188,000 business a month and how you can copy & paste it for FREE.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are like me then my guess is..You have tried so many things online just to earn some money and take care of your urgent problems but they all failed.. Yes I know, it's never easy.
      </p>
      <p>Just like you, I have tried soo much.</p>
      <p>
        From MMM to Ultimate Cycler, to NNU, to giftalworld and the rest until August 8th 2020, when I came across Affiliate Marketing for the first time.
      </p>      
      <p>
        Believe me i didnt even listen to my friend who told me about this business until he went ahead to make over N150,000 in just one week.
      </p>
      <p>
        I still didnt believe him because I didn't understand how a young guy of just 25 years old would make such amount using just his phone alone.
      </p>
      <p>
        So I made a research about this business and found out that it was simply just selling other peoples products and earning a commission for each sale.
      </p>
      <p>And just like every other thing in life it is not easy.</p>
      <p>
        It requires work, but anyone with half a brain and anyone who can read this story till this point will definitely earn a lot from it.
      </p>
      <p>
        I started with watching a FREE training on how it works and I can share that with you.
      </p>
      <p>I didn't need to create any product and neither do you...</p>
      <p>
        I just needed to sell helpful products (I didn't even create) to people who need them and can afford them and the creators will pay me anywhere from N12,500 - N22,500 or even N50,000 per sale.
      </p>
      <p>
        That means with only 2 sales a day at the lowest price possible and I will be earning about N750,000 monthly ( [N12,500 x 2] x 30 days )
      </p>
      <p>Plus I only needed N20,000 capital to start this business</p>
      <p>Still hesistant? Check out testimonies of people benefitting from it</p>

        <p>Who said Making Money Online is not easy?</p>
      <p>
        But I was what you can call a doubting Thomas so it took me a while to get started with this business...
      </p>
      <p>
        Now one year down the line I am earning N150-200k monthly.. that's about 50k weekly. Check out my recent payslip below
      </p>
      <div class="proof-1 grid">
        <img src="img/recentPay.jpg" alt="">
      </div>
      <p>I made a convenient sale the previous week using my phone casually</p>
      <div class="proof">
        <div class="proof-2 grid">
          <img class="pay-img" src="img/previousPay.jpg" alt="">
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        Even Consultants, Doctors, Lawyers and Bankers in this country can only dream of such monthly Income
      </p>
      <p>
        Maybe you're an average Nigerian and you want to know how to make an extra N250,000 monthly like my mentees below
      </p>
      <div class="testimony">        
        <div class="testimony-1 grid">
          <img class="pay-img" src="img/menteePay-1.jpg" alt="">
          <img class="pay-img" src="img/menteePay-2.jpg" alt="">
        </div>

        <div class="testimony-2">
          <img class="pay-img" src="img/menteePay.jpg" alt="">
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        Or you already have a job but the money from it is not enough and you just need a side hustle that earns you a minimum of N250,000 monthly.
      </p>
